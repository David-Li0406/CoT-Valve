Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs.\n2. He has two more white chickens than red chickens.\n\nWe can translate these statements into equations.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, we can write:\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]\n\nThe second statement tells us that the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:\n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nLet's expand and simplify this equation:\n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we'll subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( r \\):\n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]\n\nThen, we'll divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[ r = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Jerry has 4 red chickens.\n\nTo verify, let's find the number of white chickens and check the total number of eggs:\n\\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total number of eggs:\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \\]\n\nThis matches the given number of eggs collected per day, so our solution is correct.</think>\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}"

"<think>Let's think through this step by step. We have a 32-page tabloid, and we're folding a piece of paper vertically and then unfolding it. The pages are arranged in a specific way: page 1 is on the left back, page 2 is on the left front, page 32 is on the right back, and page 31 is on the right front.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize how the pages are laid out when the paper is folded and then unfolded. When you fold a piece of paper vertically and unfold it, you essentially have two layers of paper: one on the left and one on the right.\n\nLet's consider that each fold doubles the number of pages because each fold creates two new pages. So, starting with one piece of paper:\n\n1. After the first fold, you have 2 pages (left and right).\n2. After the second fold, you have 4 pages (each side is folded again, doubling the pages).\n3. This pattern continues, so after n folds, you have 2^n pages.\n\nGiven that we have 32 pages, we can set up the equation:\n\n2^n = 32\n\nTo find n, we can solve for n:\n\nn = log2(32)\n\nSince 32 is 2^5, n = 5.\n\nSo, it would take 5 folds to get 32 pages. However, the question is asking for how many pieces of paper are used, not how many folds.\n\nEach fold doubles the number of pages, but it's still the same piece of paper being folded multiple times. So, regardless of the number of folds, it's still just one piece of paper.\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}</think>\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning. If we have one piece of paper and we fold it 5 times, we indeed get 32 pages. Each fold doubles the number of pages, and since we're dealing with a single piece of paper, the number of pieces remains 1."

"<think>Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the given information:\n   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles.\n   - 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\n   - The candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode.\n\n2. Let's break down the problem:\n   - We need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.\n\n3. We know that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles could potentially explode.\n\n4. Let's calculate the number of candles that could potentially explode:\n   - 1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles\n\n5. Now, we need to consider the 5% of the more dangerous candles that also have a defect making them smell like wet dog:\n   - 5% of the 50,000 candles = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles\n\n6. However, we need to find the overlap between these two groups:\n   - We need to find how many candles are both in the 1% that could explode and the 5% that smell like wet dog.\n\n7. Since the 5% that smell like wet dog is a subset of the more dangerous candles, and we're looking for the intersection of the 1% that could explode and the 5% that smell like wet dog, we need to consider the proportion of the 5% that could explode.\n\n8. The probability that a candle that smells like wet dog will explode is the same as the overall probability of a candle exploding, which is 1%.\n\n9. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:\n   - 1% of the 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles\n\n10. So, the final answer is:\n    - 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.</think>\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{25}"

This means it's actually 4% higher than the set temperature.\n\nNow, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set to get a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% off.\n\nLet's denote the temperature she should set as x. Since the oven is 4% off, the actual temperature will be x + 4% of x, which is 1.04x.\n\nWe want this to equal 520 degrees:\n\n1.04x = 520\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 520 / 1.04\nx = 500\n\nSo, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to get a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{500}</think>\n\nLet's double-check this:\n\nIf she sets it to 500 degrees, and the oven is 4% off, the actual temperature will be:\n\n500 * 1.04 = 520 degrees\n\nThis matches the recipe's requirement. So, our answer is correct."
"<think>Okay, so Max wants to watch two movies this weekend, and I need to find out how long it will take him in total. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. I need to add these two durations together to get the total time.\n\nFirst, I should convert the hours into minutes because the answer needs to be in minutes. I know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.\n\nSo, for the first movie:\n1 hour = 60 minutes\nPlus 30 minutes\nTotal for the first movie = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes\n\nFor the second movie:\n2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes\nPlus 5 minutes\nTotal for the second movie = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes\n\nNow, I need to add the total minutes of both movies together:\n90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes\n\nSo, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{215}</think>\n\nI should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Calvin is an adult, and his wife is also an adult, so they will each eat one adult bowl. Their two children will each eat one child bowl. Therefore, the total amount of soup used during dinner is:\n\n- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife)\n- 2 child bowls (for their two children)\n\nSo, the total soup used is 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls.\n\nNow, we need to determine how much soup is left after dinner.

"<think>Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. All the sisters are 16 years old. So, the total age for the sisters would be:\n\n3 sisters * 16 years each = 48 years\n\nNext, we have the brothers. One brother is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother. So, if the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, then:\n\nOlder brother's age = 2 * 12 years = 24 years\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age for the brothers:\n\n12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 36 years\n\nFinally, to find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total ages of the sisters and the brothers:\n\nTotal age = 48 years (sisters) + 36 years (brothers) = 84 years\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{84}</think>\n\nSo, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
